### Comments for the TA

Hello Ivana,

In our preliminary draft, we've chosen to consolidate statistics from a specific previous game in Slovenia, with our main focus on extracting and elucidating the data.

For the final version, we plan to:

1. Gather statistics for all previous matches.
2. Potentially include more advanced metrics like pitch control.
3. Not only describe the statistics but also analyze them, illustrating situations in which Slovenia could be strong or expose weaknesses.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 General comments

Despite Denmark holding the 21st position in the FIFA rankings, and Slovenia being ranked at 55, overlooking a theoretically weaker opponent is never advisable. During the last game against Slovenia (Qualifiers Euro 23) we won with 2-1 in a complicated game while we got a draw 6 month earlier with 1-1 (Qualifiers Euro 23). In this analysis, we'll provide you with all the essential keys to ensure success against Slovenia in the upcoming match.

Our preparation for the group match of the European Championship consists in a first step of the analysis of the direct encounter between Denmark and Slovenia in the European Championship qualification which took place on 17.11.23. In a further analysis in the next draft, additional meshes will be added to support our statements.

Based on information from multiple sources, it's seems evident that Slovenia's team possesses notable strengths at some positions. Specifically, their goalkeeper, currently playing for Atl√©tico, stands out, alongside midfielders Benjamin Sesko and Jaka Bijol. Given their midfield/attack roles, it's reasonable to anticipate Slovenia boasting a strong midfield/attack presence.

After analyzing their recent matches, it's evident that Slovenia employed a traditional 4-4-2 formation with no unexpected variations in player selection. Additionally, one of the standout players we identified, Sesko, managed to score a goal during the game. We should keep in mind that the 4-4-2 formation brings a central presence that enables counter-attacks.

### 1.3 Injured & suspended players

Currently Benjamin Verbiƒç is injured and doesn't have an official return date. No suspension need to be taken into account at this point.

## 2. Statistics of Slovenia's recent games

### 2.1 Formation and line up

We start first by analysing the common composition of Slovenia. In the last 10 games against Portugal, Malta, USA, Kazakhstan, Denamrk, North Ireland and Finland, Slovenia used 9 times a 4-4-2 composition and the only modified composition was when Benjamin Sesko wasn't available. Therefore we can excpect the composition to be probably the same. Here is a quick recap of pro ans cons of the 4-4-2 composition.

| 26 Mar vs Portugal | 21 Mar vs Malta | 20 Jan vs USA | 20 Nov vs Kazakhstan | 17 Nov vs Denmark |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |

Here is a quick refresh of the pros and cons of 4-4-2:

**Pros :** With a strong defense, wide attack, and quick movement into the opponent's territory, the 4-4-2 excels in counter-attacks. Defensively, it allows for a compact setup with two lines of four players, while the forwards remain poised for quick offensive opportunities. The presence of two strikers presents a unique challenge for defenders, as it reduces time and space on the ball and increases the threat of one-on-one situations. Additionally, passing out from the back becomes more challenging with constant pressure from two attackers.

**Cons :** In a 4-4-2 formation, teams may struggle to control the midfield, especially against opponents using a midfield trio, leading to less possession. Additionally, the 4-4-2 lacks defensive depth, as players within the same line may leave gaps. Despite being compact, this formation is vulnerable to line-breaking passes, making it easier for opponents to bypass multiple players at once. Defensive setups like the 4-1-4-1 offer better coverage between the lines.When attacking, the midfield and defensive lines align closely, restricting forward passing options. This setup can limit the team's ability to create passing opportunities compared to formations with players spread across different lines.

### 2.2 Key statistics


We start by analyzing the direct qualifier match between Denmark and Slovenia on November 17, 2023. The game was largely dominated by Denmark, as evidenced by their 70% possession and a significant advantage in passes, which was double that of Slovenia's. The dominance was further highlighted by the shots on target, with Denmark having 8 compared to Slovenia's 1.

Despite the apparent control over the game by Denmark, the margin of victory was narrow, with Denmark winning by just one goal. This outcome is further clarified upon examining the expected goals metric. Denmark's expected goals stood at 1.33, indicating that despite their dominance, they struggled to create substantial scoring opportunities. On the other hand, Slovenia's expected goals were at 0.13, suggesting their goal could be attributed to a fortunate strike rather than a consistent offensive effort.

## 3. In possesion - attack of Slovenia

Our analysis of Slovenia's attacking performance in the European Championship qualifier against Denmark on November 17, 2023, serves as the initial basis for evaluating their offensive strategy. Future analyses will encompass a broader range of matches to provide a more comprehensive assessment.

### 3.1 Attacking style:

Slovenia's approach to attacking was markedly different from Denmark's, particularly in their avoidance of prolonged build-up plays. Instead, Slovenia's offensive strategy was predominantly characterized by quick counter-attacks and the utilization of long balls to advance up the field swiftly when in possession.

### 3.2 Attacking efficiency

The effectiveness of Slovenia's attacking maneuvers was notably lacking. A mere 1% of their attacking efforts resulted in a shot, with none of these attempts being on target. The sole goal they managed to score originated from a free kick taken approximately 35 meters from the goal. Additionally, Slovenia's performance in offensive duels and dribbling was significantly inferior to that of Denmark, further highlighting the inefficacies in their attacking play.

### 3.3 Passing network & Player Heatmap

### Passing network

In the picture you can see the more passes have been played by a player. The bigger his name circle. The position of the circle was determined by taking the average position of all the passes made by a player. 

A look at Slovenia's passing network mirrors the statistics from chapter 2. Slovenia were pushed in behind and were rarely able to create a successful build-up between defence and midfield, which points to the many passes between the two centre-backs (Bijol and Blazic) and Oblak. Denmark managed to isolate the midfield and attack from the game, leaving the defence with only the pass to the centre-back or goalkeeper.

Kranicnik takes on an exciting position in the network. His high pass rate could indicate an inverted right-back. However, it also suggests that the build-up was often attempted via the right flank with Karnicnik and Cerin as the main figures.

### Centrality metrics

We analyze key centrality metrics and output the 3 strongest players for each metrics:

#### Degree Centrality

Quantifies received passes relative to total players. $`C_D(v) = \frac{\text{Number of passes received by } v}{\text{Total number of players}} = \sum_{u \neq v} A_{uv}`$

| Player  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A. ƒåerin  | 1.5333  |
| J. Bijol | 1.4667  |
| ≈Ω. Karniƒçnik  | 1.3333  |


#### Betweenness Centrality

Identifies players crucial for ball circulation, calculated by their role in shortest paths between others. $`C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}`$

| Player  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| V. Drku≈°iƒá|  0.1163  |
| A. ƒåerin| 0.0945 |
| ≈Ω. Karniƒçnik| 0.0827  |


#### Closeness Centrality

Evaluates proximity to others in the network for efficient pass reception. $`C_C(v) = \frac{1}{\sum_{u} d(u, v)}`$

| Player  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| J. Bijol|  0.7500  |
| A. ƒåerin|  0.7500 |
|B. ≈†e≈°ko| 0.7500 |

#### PageRank Centrality

Assesses a player's influence, considering both connection quantity and quality, akin to Google's PageRank algorithm. $`C_E(v) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{u} A_{uv} C_E(u)`$


| Player  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ≈Ω. Karniƒçnik|  0.1125  |
| J. Bijol|  0.0986 |
|A. ƒåerin| 0.0949 |

### Attacking Players Heatmap

In order to analyze Slovenian's attacking behavior, let's take a look at the thermal images of the attacking and midfield players. From the passing Network from chapter 3.1 and the generated images there is a soft tendency that the attacking play is more developped on the right side, through Vipotnik and Verbic/Mlakar. Mlakar and Verbic kept changing their starting positions during the game. Only on the counterattacks do they act as offensive wingers and only then do they give the strikers the opportunity to move into the center. The outside midfielders are therefore very defensively prepared for this game and help out the full-backs.

It is also clear that Slovenian were mainly occupied with defending and Sesko and Vipotnik therefore received little support up front. Elsnik and Cerin took over the position of the typical number 8 and rarely dropped deep to the side and kept the center closed.

### 3.4 Typical tactical moves

#### 3.4.1 Long passes

The Slovenians' great strength lies in the long passes from their two central defenders. The long passes from the full-backs have a high error rate. Especially the right side. Slovenia often need this type of pass to get out of pressure situations. However, with a relatively baleful outcome

#### 3.4.2 Crosses

There is no preferred side in the flank play and a clear key player.

#### 3.4.3 Shots 

What is striking about this statistic is that only shots were taken from the second row and therefore from long range. The two strikers did not get a shot on target. Two shots and only one on goal shows how busy Slovenia were defending. Slovenia's efficiency and above all Janza's shooting technique is astonishing. There is a slight tendency to shoot from the right.

#### 3.4.4 Dribblings
Dribbling has only been implemented for the wingers in Slovenia's game. You can rarely expect dribbling from Elsnik and Cerin from the center.
Verbic's dribbling strength in particular must be emphasized here. There is an increased number of dribbles on the right-hand side with a high chance of success.

#### 3.4.5 Interceptions

Surprisingly, in the center of the Slovenian defense there is a 50/50 chance of success from intercepted balls. Certainly a weak point that Denmark can exploit by coming through the middle or from the left. The right side with Verbic and Karnicnik seems to be like a wall that is difficult to overcome and has a 100% rate of interceptions.

The Slovenians are disciplined and there is a high incidence of fouls in Slovenia's defensive central midfield. Despite a period of high pressure throughout the game, the Slovenians were not tempted to commit many tactical fouls, which indicated that the team was deep and therefore did not allow the Danes to counter-attack. The central midfield did not seem insurmountable and the central midfielders were often only able to help themselves with fouls.

## 4 Out of possesion - defense of Slovenia

Our analysis of Slovenia's defensive performance in the European Championship qualifier against Denmark on November 17, 2023, serves as the initial basis for evaluating their offensive strategy. Future analyses will encompass a broader range of matches to provide a more comprehensive assessment.

### 4.1 Statistics

The defensive performance of Slovenia in the match clearly illustrates that their primary focus was on maintaining a robust defense, engaging in almost double the number of defensive duels compared to Denmark. Despite the intense defensive activity, the play remained mostly disciplined, with both teams committing 13 fouls each and Slovenia receiving only one yellow card.

### 4.2 Defensive efficiency & style

Slovenia's defensive efforts were markedly more dominant and effective than their attacking endeavors. They outperformed Denmark in terms of winning defensive duels, with a success rate of nearly 80% in their defensive third. Furthermore, Slovenia made fewer defensive errors compared to their opponents, contributing to their solid defensive performance.

In terms of their defensive approach, Slovenia opted for a more conservative style. Rather than engaging in aggressive high pressing, they predominantly focused on maintaining a deep defensive line, concentrating their efforts on defending within their own third.

It's clear to see that the 4-man chain was played consistently throughout the game and that they stayed true to their strategy. In other words, the coach doesn't allow himself to be tempted into plan B, C or D, but draws a clear line. Karnicnik is talented on both feet, which must be taken into account when analyzing the game. In very rare cases, the chain dared to cross the halfway line, but for the majority of the game, it certainly focused solely on defending.

### 4.3 Duel defence performance of the players
In this section the players of the match Denmark-Slovenia on 17.11.2023 are analyzed regarding the duel performance while defending.

#### 4.3.1 Total duels and duels won: Slovenia
The plot below shows the duel performance of the players from Slovenia. It can be seen that J. Bijpol has the most duels with a total of 13. That showcases that Slovenia had to do a lot of defending and especially J. Bijpol made a big impact in the defending line of Slovenia with 11 duels won. Further more the second CB M. Bla≈æiƒç with a total of 7 duels and 6 won duels strenghted the defense of Slovenia as well. A. ƒåerin made a lot of work in the defence too with a total of 10 duels. Although with only 5 won duels he has a percentage of won duels of 50%, which is improvable.

![duel_performance_svn_final](uploads/853d576009a2834f0b53a4eb90a09da2/duel_performance_svn_final.png)

#### 4.3.2 Duels won percentage: Slovenia
It can be higlighted here that the percentage won of J. Bijol, M. Bla≈æiƒç, B. Verbiƒç and J. Kurtiƒç is over 75%. Therefore they strenghed the defense of slovenia considerably.
J. Kurtiƒç has a percentage of 100%. It has to be considered here that J. Kurtiƒç was substituted in minute 62. Therefore the message of the most percentage needs to be analyzed with the minutes played per player as well.

![duel_percentage_sorted_svn_final](uploads/cd3e796ac13b153997420196cf02b000/duel_percentage_sorted_svn_final.png)

#### 4.3.3 Total duels and duels won: Denmark
Like mentioned in Section 4.2 Denmark was outperformed regarding the defense statistics. V. Kristiansen, J. Maehle and J. Andersen had a total of 6, 6 and 5 total duels. All of them won 4 duels. Therefore it can be said that the CB and RWB of Denmark defend with effort and win most of their defence duels. In the following plot the statistics of Denmark can be seen with all player that had a duel.

![duel_performance_dnk_final](uploads/66b057caa633789604a75eb70511a062/duel_performance_dnk_final.png)

#### 4.3.4 Duels won percentage: Denmark
With J. Andersen, V. Kristiansen and J. Maehle the defence line of denmark has a percentage of over 65% duels won, which is acceptable but also can be improven.
It has to be mentioned that Y. Poulsen with a total of 4 duels and 3 duels won has a percentage of won duels of 75%. The help of the strikers in defending mode can have a big impact on whether the game is won or lost.
In the plot below the stats of Denmark are shown.

### 4.4 Goalkeeper behaviour

To the analysis of the defense the goal keeper needs also to be considered. He is a main part of the defense not only that he is the last man who can save a shot on target but also for his view over the pitch. He can manage his defense optimal and help the defense to understand the play style of the opponent strikers. In the first part the shot parried per goalkeeper are analysed and in the second part the passes played per goalkeeper.

#### 4.4.1 Shots parried per goalkeeper

It can be seen two plot below that Denmark had a total of 8 shot on target and 2 goals scored. For J. Oblak, the goalkeeper of Slovenia, it therefore makes a percentage of parried shots on targets of 75%.
With a percentage parried of 0% K. Schmeichel the goalkeeper of Denmark does not have a good statistic only regarding the game from November 17, 2023. With a shot on target of 1 and 1 scored goal the Slovenien strikers where 100% effective when the shot was on target.

By analayzing the goal zone where the shot hit the goal it can be seen which saves the goalkeepers needed to do. In the following picture the goal zones according to Wyscout are shown.

![wyscout_goal](uploads/1fad8af06a7d6a3d097f200d43c1e6ca/wyscout_goal.png)

It can be seen from the chart below that J. Oblak had to parry a lot of low shots in the centre and his left corner.
The shot from Slovenia, it was a free kick, was shot in the top right corner from striker side of view and K. Schmeichel was not able to parry the shot.

#### 4.4.2 Passes played per goalkeeper

Like mentioned above the goalkeeper is a main part of the defense. With the ability to really take part in the game and create possible pass stations the goalkeeper can be the one additional man in the defense line. It is possible to make changes of side or also launch a quick attack with a long shot of the goalkeeper.
In the following chart it can be seen that K. Schmeichel had a total of 24 passes. He was often used to calm down the defense and waiting for the right time to launch an attack. Furthermore with a total of 10 high and long passes K. Schmeichel made some passes near and over the own pitch half to start an attack.
J. Oblak had a total of 18 passes and only 5 high and long passes. This reflects that Slovenia had its main focus on defending and was not often able to get out of their half.

## 5. Set plays

### 5.1 Corners

This section analyzes the corners of the match between Denmark and Slovenia on 17.11.2023 and their impact on the game. Corners are a very important part of the game of football as they can often lead to scoring opportunities for the attacking team, but also to counter-attacking opportunities for the defending team. As can be seen from the following graph of corner events, Denmark was the more dominant team, with regards to corners.

![corner_statistics](uploads/ea0c3cce26886caefb3f02849a219339/corner_statistics.png)

In total, Denmark received 8 corners and Slovenia only 2. With 8 corners in a match, we can take a closer look at Denmark's offensive tactics and Slovenia's defensive tactics. The statistics of the corners show that 3 of the corners resulted in a shot, 2 of which were on target and 1 was a goal.

If we take a look at the map of the Danes' pass receiver position, we can see more details of their offensive tactics.

![corner_recipient_loc_DEN](uploads/acc2d2fb1bc633cc68d582252454a112/corner_recipient_loc_DEN.png)

87.5% of their corners found their target in the middle of the penalty area, while 12.5% were hit far behind the penalty area.

A look at the map of shots after corners shows what happened at the dangerous corners.

![Denmark_shots_corners_map](uploads/991497378c8da09751e25d593d0e6d43/Denmark_shots_corners_map.png)

It is possible to see the shooting positions of the 3 shots after the corners. From this map you can conclude that Denmark is pretty good at generating shooting opportunities after corners if these are whipped into the center of the penalty area. You can also see that Slovenia had trouble defending M. Jensen in aerial duels, as he is their main shot creator from corners with two shots and one goal.

The same analysis can be done for Slovenia as an attacking team. As we can see from the statistics of corner kicks, 1 of the 2 corners resulted in a shot that was not on target.

![corner_recipient_loc_SVN](uploads/e5f63c2932336cc2dc3eee0ce2899d70/corner_recipient_loc_SVN.png)

As Slovenia only had two corner kicks, they could not try multiple corner kick tactics, and as can be seen from the corner kick recipient locations map, all of their corner kick targets were inside the penalty area.

We can get more information from the shots after corner for Slovenia map.

![Slovenia_shots_corners_map](uploads/157bdc7c2df9a1e1cc81d41e02e37c7d/Slovenia_shots_corners_map.png)

We see that one of the corners, which was originally targeted at the center of the penalty area, was deflected and immediately taken by M. Zajc as a shot, but not on target and therefore not particularly dangerous.

After corners, there is often an opportunity to launch a counter-attack if they are defended properly. Therefore, we looked at the consecutive counter-attacks after corners for this game, but in this case there were none, as the advanced statistics of corner events show.

### 5.3 Free kicks

This section analyzes the free kicks of the match between Denmark and Slovenia on 17.11.2023 and their impact on the game. Free kicks, especially the closer they get to the goal, are a very important part of the game.

If you look at the Slovenia free-kick map, you can see 4 different types of free-kicks. First, the goal kick, which we defined as a free kick inside your own penalty area. Secondly, the shot, which is a free kick that is taken directly as a shot on goal, regardless of whether it is on target or not. Thirdly, the cross, which is a free kick that is used to directly create a promising attacking opportunity by hitting the ball into the penalty area, but is not taken as a shot. And the "Else" category, which serves as a catch-all for all other types of free kicks.

![Slovenia_freekick_map](uploads/36588b8d1c739c77db3adafc09e9cc3d/Slovenia_freekick_map.png)

From Slovenia's free-kick map, it can be deduced that Slovenia were pushed back deep into their own half by Denmark's pressing and were sometimes able to get a free-kick out of it. Slovenia also had a direct free-kick from E. Janza, which he was able to convert into a goal. As they are 1 for 1 in goals scored from free kicks, they appear to be very dangerous in this area of the game.

![Denmark_freekick_map](uploads/f59e996fe396b12027c53bf668ab0c63/Denmark_freekick_map.png)

Denmark's free-kick map shows that the Danes were often stopped by fouls in the build-up to their attacking play, as their free kicks are usually taken at the end of the second third of the pitch. Slovenia also managed to avoid free kicks near their own goal, meaning that Denmark only had one opportunity for an attacking free kick.

It is also possible to see when teams consider the distance to goal suitable for an attacking free kick such as a shot or a cross.

![avg_distance_freekick_slov](uploads/912d9baf2bdba9484f6c3781a1ebb1a4/avg_distance_freekick_slov.png)

With Slovenia, we see that most of the free kicks were around 80 meters, so neither suitable for a cross nor for a direct shot. But as soon as they were closer than 30 meters, they shot directly and were quite efficient in this game. Since they didn't have an offensive free kick cross, we can't say much about that.

![avg_distance_freekick_den](uploads/a84702827a54b3dc3cf573f59260b869/avg_distance_freekick_den.png)

With Denmark, we see that most of the free kicks were taken around the 70m mark, so they are not suitable for either a cross or a direct shot, but this suggests that they were a bit more offensive than the Slovenians. When they get closer to goal, around the 40-meter mark, they start using the free kicks as crosses. Since they didn't have a direct free kick shot, we can't say much about that.

To see which players shoot free kicks most often, we have listed all players in a diagram.

![freekick_takers_slov](uploads/2387a36bb0e4dae0f0df78039217588f/freekick_takers_slov.png)

With Slovenia, you can see that they had a lot of goal kicks and free kicks which defenders like Bijol took, indicating that they were constantly under pressure and in risky situations in their own half around the penalty area.

![freekick_takers_den](uploads/2c52c831c4fb27a3eefe4665bae9b173/freekick_takers_den.png)

Denmark's most prominent free kick taker is midfielder P. Hojberg. This suggests that they have been fouled mainly in the build-up to their attacking play.

To summarize, Slovenia doesn't seem to get many dangerous free-kicks, but when they do, they are very dangerous. Slovenia seems to try to disrupt the Danish build-up play by fouling the Danes in midfield in the Slovenian half, but not in the attacking positions around the penalty area. Denmark could exploit this by playing more 1-v-1 situations as Slovenia seems to defend passively and does not try to risk a free kick near the goal.

### 9.3 Weaknesses

**Lack of Depth**: While Slovenia possesses quality in key positions, their squad depth may be a concern, especially in midfield and defensive areas.

**Vulnerability to High Pressure**: Slovenia's reliance on quick transitions leaves them susceptible to high-pressing opponents who disrupt their build-up play and force turnovers in dangerous areas.

**Inexperience in Key Areas**: Despite the presence of talented individuals, Slovenia may lack experience in high-pressure situations, particularly in international competitions, which could affect their decision-making and composure.
