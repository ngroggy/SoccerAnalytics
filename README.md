```fix``` – a bug fix has occurred  
```chore``` – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)  
```refactor``` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature  
```docs``` – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files  
```style``` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.  
```test``` – including new or correcting previous tests  
```perf``` – performance improvements  
```ci``` – continuous integration related  
```build``` – changes that affect the build system or external   dependencies
