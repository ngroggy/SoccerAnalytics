# Preparation Denmark to play against Slovenia ![Slovenia](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevenrskelton/flag-icon/master/png/16/country-4x3/si.png "Slovenia")

### Introduction

Despite Denmark holding the 21st position in the FIFA rankings, and Slovenia being ranked at 55, overlooking a theoretically weaker opponent is never advisable. In this analysis, we'll provide you with all the essential keys to ensure success against Slovenia in the upcoming match.

## Idea for report structure:
- Introduction to the 2 teams (Francois, Loris)
  - FIFA/UEFA current ranking and evolution
  - common formation (starting 11, main substitutes and change of formation)
  - important/most valuable players, weak players 
  - general interesting stats (e.g. injured players, recent performance in friendly games)
  - ...

- Analysis of recent games between the 2 teams in the Qualifiers (2:1, 1:1) (Yves)
  - General stats (Possession, Shots, Shots on Target, Expected goals etc.)
  - ...

- Attack of Slovenia (Nic, Grégory)
  - Attacking style (e.g. counter attacks)
  - key players involved in chances and goals
  - amount of passes before attempted shots
  - recurring structure of attacks
  - ...

- Defense of Slovenia (Nic, Grégory)
  - Formation
  - help from non-defense players
  - Weakness (how did they concede goals?)
  - ...

- Distribution and control of Slovenia
  - heat map of possession
  - player with best/worst passing accuracy
  - players with best/worst duel performance
  - ...

- Gameplan for Denmark:
