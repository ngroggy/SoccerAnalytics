# Preparation Denmark to play against Slovenia !

## Introduction

Despite Denmark holding the 21st position in the FIFA rankings, and Slovenia being ranked at 55, overlooking a theoretically weaker opponent is never advisable. During the last game against Slovenia (Qualifiers Euro 23) we won with 2-1 in a complicated game while we got a draw 6 month earlier with 1-1 (Qualifiers Euro 23). In this analysis, we'll provide you with all the essential keys to ensure success against Slovenia in the upcoming match. 

Based on information from multiple sources, it's seems evident that Slovenia's team possesses notable strengths at some positions. Specifically, their goalkeeper, currently playing for Atl√©tico, stands out, alongside midfielders Benjamin Sesko and Jaka Bijol. Given their midfield/attack roles, it's reasonable to anticipate Slovenia boasting a strong midfield/attack presence.

After analyzing their recent match against Malta, it's evident that Slovenia employed a traditional 4-4-2 formation with no unexpected variations in player selection. Additionally, one of the standout players we identified, Sesko, managed to score a goal during the game. We should keep in mind that the 4-4-2 formation brings a central presence that enables counter-attacks.

## Statistics of Slovenia's recent games 

### Formation and line up 

We start first by analysing the common composition of Slovenia. In the last 9 games against Malta, USA, Kazakhstan, Denamrk, North Ireland and Finland, Slovenia used 8 times a 4-4-2 composition and the only modified composition was when Benjamin Sesko wasn't available. Therefore we can excpect the composition to be probably the same. Here is a quick recap of pro ans cons of the 4-4-2 composition.

Here is a quick refresh of the pros and cons of 4-4-2:

**Pros :** With a strong defense, wide attack, and quick movement into the opponent's territory, the 4-4-2 excels in counter-attacks. Defensively, it allows for a compact setup with two lines of four players, while the forwards remain poised for quick offensive opportunities. The presence of two strikers presents a unique challenge for defenders, as it reduces time and space on the ball and increases the threat of one-on-one situations. Additionally, passing out from the back becomes more challenging with constant pressure from two attackers.

**Cons :** In a 4-4-2 formation, teams may struggle to control the midfield, especially against opponents using a midfield trio, leading to less possession. Additionally, the 4-4-2 lacks defensive depth, as players within the same line may leave gaps. Despite being compact, this formation is vulnerable to line-breaking passes, making it easier for opponents to bypass multiple players at once. Defensive setups like the 4-1-4-1 offer better coverage between the lines.When attacking, the midfield and defensive lines align closely, restricting forward passing options. This setup can limit the team's ability to create passing opportunities compared to formations with players spread across different lines.
