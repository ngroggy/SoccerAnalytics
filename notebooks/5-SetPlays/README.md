### 5.1 Corners

This section analyzes the corners of the match between Denmark and Slovenia on 17.11.2023 and their impact on the game. Corners are a very important part of the game of football as they can often lead to scoring opportunities for the attacking team, but also to counter-attacking opportunities for the defending team. As can be seen from the following graph of corner events, Denmark was the more dominant team, with regards to corners. 

![cornerstats](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/corner_statistics.png)

In total, Denmark received 8 corners and Slovenia only 2. With 8 corners in a match, we can take a closer look at Denmark's offensive tactics and Slovenia's defensive tactics. The statistics of the corners show that 3 of the corners resulted in a shot, 2 of which were on target and 1 was a goal.

If we take a look at the map of the Danes' pass receiver position, we can see more details of their offensive tactics.

87.5% of their corners found their target in the middle of the penalty area, while 12.5% were hit far behind the penalty area.

A look at the map of shots after corners shows what happened at the dangerous corners.

It is possible to see the shooting positions of the 3 shots after the corners. From this map you can conclude that Denmark is pretty good at generating shooting opportunities after corners if these are whipped into the center of the penalty area. You can also see that Slovenia had trouble defending M. Jensen in aerial duels, as he is their main shot creator from corners with two shots and one goal.

The same analysis can be done for Slovenia as an attacking team. As we can see from the statistics of corner kicks, 1 of the 2 corners resulted in a shot that was not on target.

![crl_svn](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/corner_recipient_loc_SVN.png)

As Slovenia only had two corner kicks, they could not try multiple corner kick tactics, and as can be seen from the corner kick recipient locations map, all of their corner kick targets were inside the penalty area.

We can get more information from the shots after corner for Slovenia map.

![csm_svn](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/Slovenia_shots_corners_map.png)

We see that one of the corners, which was originally targeted at the center of the penalty area, was deflected and immediately taken by M. Zajc as a shot, but not on target and therefore not particularly dangerous.

After corners, there is often an opportunity to launch a counter-attack if they are defended properly. Therefore, we looked at the consecutive counter-attacks after corners for this game, but in this case there were none, as the advanced statistics of corner events show.
