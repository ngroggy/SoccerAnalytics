### 5.1 Corners

This section analyzes the corners of the match between Denmark and Slovenia on 17.11.2023 and their impact on the game. Corners are a very important part of the game of football as they can often lead to scoring opportunities for the attacking team, but also to counter-attacking opportunities for the defending team. As can be seen from the following graph of corner events, Denmark was the more dominant team, with regards to corners. 

![cornerstats](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/corner_statistics.png)

In total, Denmark received 8 corners and Slovenia only 2. With 8 corners in a match, we can take a closer look at Denmark's offensive tactics and Slovenia's defensive tactics. The statistics of the corners show that 3 of the corners resulted in a shot, 2 of which were on target and 1 was a goal.

If we take a look at the map of the Danes' pass receiver position, we can see more details of their offensive tactics.

![crl_svn](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/corner_recipient_loc_DEN.png)

87.5% of their corners found their target in the middle of the penalty area, while 12.5% were hit far behind the penalty area.

A look at the map of shots after corners shows what happened at the dangerous corners.

![csm_den](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/Denmark_shots_corners_map.png)

It is possible to see the shooting positions of the 3 shots after the corners. From this map you can conclude that Denmark is pretty good at generating shooting opportunities after corners if these are whipped into the center of the penalty area. You can also see that Slovenia had trouble defending M. Jensen in aerial duels, as he is their main shot creator from corners with two shots and one goal.

The same analysis can be done for Slovenia as an attacking team. As we can see from the statistics of corner kicks, 1 of the 2 corners resulted in a shot that was not on target.

![crl_svn](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/corner_recipient_loc_SVN.png)

As Slovenia only had two corner kicks, they could not try multiple corner kick tactics, and as can be seen from the corner kick recipient locations map, all of their corner kick targets were inside the penalty area.

We can get more information from the shots after corner for Slovenia map.

![csm_svn](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_1-Corners/Slovenia_shots_corners_map.png)

We see that one of the corners, which was originally targeted at the center of the penalty area, was deflected and immediately taken by M. Zajc as a shot, but not on target and therefore not particularly dangerous.

After corners, there is often an opportunity to launch a counter-attack if they are defended properly. Therefore, we looked at the consecutive counter-attacks after corners for this game, but in this case there were none, as the advanced statistics of corner events show.

### 5.2 Penalties

There were no penalties in the match between Denmark and Slovenia on 17.11.2023, which is why this section is not covered in the first draft.

### 5.3 Free kicks

This section analyzes the free kicks of the match between Denmark and Slovenia on 17.11.2023 and their impact on the game. Free kicks, especially the closer they get to the goal, are a very important part of the game.

If you look at the Slovenia free-kick map, you can see 4 different types of free-kicks. First, the goal kick, which we defined as a free kick inside your own penalty area. Secondly, the shot, which is a free kick that is taken directly as a shot on goal, regardless of whether it is on target or not. Thirdly, the cross, which is a free kick that is used to directly create a promising attacking opportunity by hitting the ball into the penalty area, but is not taken as a shot. And the "Else" category, which serves as a catch-all for all other types of free kicks. 

![fk_map](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_3-FreeKicks/Slovenia_freekick_map.png)

From Slovenia's free-kick map, it can be deduced that Slovenia were pushed back deep into their own half by Denmark's pressing and were sometimes able to get a free-kick out of it. Slovenia also had a direct free-kick from E. Janza, which he was able to convert into a goal. As they are 1 for 1 in goals scored from free kicks, they appear to be very dangerous in this area of the game.

![fk_map](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_3-FreeKicks/Denmark_freekick_map.png)

Denmark's free-kick map shows that the Danes were often stopped by fouls in the build-up to their attacking play, as their free kicks are usually taken at the end of the second third of the pitch. Slovenia also managed to avoid free kicks near their own goal, meaning that Denmark only had one opportunity for an attacking free kick.

It is also possible to see when teams consider the distance to goal suitable for an attacking free kick such as a shot or a cross. 

![fk_avgdst_svn](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_3-FreeKicks/avg_distance_freekick_slov.png)

With Slovenia, we see that most of the free kicks were around 80 meters, so neither suitable for a cross nor for a direct shot. But as soon as they were closer than 30 meters, they shot directly and were quite efficient in this game. Since they didn't have an offensive free kick cross, we can't say much about that.

![fk_avgdst_den](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_3-FreeKicks/avg_distance_freekick_den.png)

With Denmark, we see that most of the free kicks were taken around the 70m mark, so they are not suitable for either a cross or a direct shot, but this suggests that they were a bit more offensive than the Slovenians. When they get closer to goal, around the 40-meter mark, they start using the free kicks as crosses. Since they didn't have a direct free kick shot, we can't say much about that.

To see which players shoot free kicks most often, we have listed all players in a diagram.

![fk_player](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_3-FreeKicks/freekick_takers_slov.png)

With Slovenia, you can see that they had a lot of goal kicks and free kicks which defenders like Bijol took, indicating that they were constantly under pressure and in risky situations in their own half around the penalty area.

![fk_player](./plots/5-SetPieces/5_3-FreeKicks/freekick_takers_den.png)

Denmark's most prominent free kick taker is midfielder P. Hojberg. This suggests that they have been fouled mainly in the build-up to their attacking play.

To summarize, Slovenia doesn't seem to get many dangerous free-kicks, but when they do, they are very dangerous. Slovenia seems to try to disrupt the Danish build-up play by fouling the Danes in midfield in the Slovenian half, but not in the attacking positions around the penalty area. Denmark could exploit this by playing more 1-v-1 situations as Slovenia seems to defend passively and does not try to risk a free kick near the goal.
